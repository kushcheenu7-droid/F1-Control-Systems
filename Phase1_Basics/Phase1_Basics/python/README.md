# Python – Control System Simulations

## First Order System
This script simulates the step response of a first-order system using
its analytical solution.

### Parameters
- `tau`: Time constant (system speed)
- `K`: System gain

### Learning Outcome
- Understand transient response
- Relate physical parameters to system behavior
- Visualize control concepts using Python
