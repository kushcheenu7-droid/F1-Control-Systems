# Phase 2 – Vehicle Dynamics (Motorsport Focus)

This phase focuses on modeling longitudinal vehicle dynamics with
applications to motorsport braking performance.

## Objectives
- Model vehicle braking behavior
- Understand tire–road interaction
- Prepare foundation for ABS and control logic

## Topics Covered
- Longitudinal braking dynamics
- Tire friction limits
- Effect of mass and speed on stopping distance

## Tools Used
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)

## Outcome
This phase bridges control theory with real vehicle physics used in
motorsport and high-performance automotive engineering.
