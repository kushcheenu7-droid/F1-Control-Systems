# Control Systems & Vehicle Dynamics – Motorsport Focus

This repository contains control system simulations and vehicle dynamics
models developed with a focus on motorsport and high-performance
automotive applications.

The work bridges **control theory**, **vehicle physics**, and
**feedback-based safety systems**.

---

## Phase 1 – Control Systems Basics
- First-order system modeling and step response
- Second-order system dynamics and damping behavior
- Time-domain analysis using Python and MATLAB

Focus:
Understanding system behavior and translating mathematical models into
working simulations.

---

## Phase 2 – Vehicle Dynamics (Braking)
- Baseline braking dynamics
- Aerodynamic downforce effects on braking
- ABS-style feedback control using slip ratio
- Comparison of open-loop vs closed-loop braking

Focus:
Applying control systems concepts to real automotive and motorsport
problems.

---

## Tools Used
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Control Systems Theory
- Vehicle Dynamics Fundamentals

---

## Motivation
This work is aimed at developing industry-relevant skills for internships
and research roles in automotive, motorsport, and avionics domains.
