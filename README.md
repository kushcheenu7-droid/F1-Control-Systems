# F1-Control-Systems
Control systems, vehicle dynamics, and simulations for motorsport applications

# Phase 1 – Engineering & Control Systems Basics

This phase focuses on building strong fundamentals required for
motorsport, automotive, and avionics control systems.

## Objectives
- Understand basic control system concepts
- Implement mathematical models in code
- Visualize system behavior using simulations

## Topics Covered
- Time-domain system response
- First and second order systems
- Physical interpretation of control parameters
- Numerical simulation using Python and MATLAB

## Tools Used
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- MATLAB

## Outcome
By the end of this phase, I will be able to:
- Translate equations into working simulations
- Interpret plots like an engineer
- Build the foundation for vehicle dynamics and control
