# Technical Summary – Control Systems & Vehicle Braking Dynamics

## Overview
This project applies control systems theory to vehicle dynamics with a
motorsport-oriented perspective.

## Control Systems
- Modeled first- and second-order dynamic systems
- Analyzed transient response and damping behavior
- Implemented simulations using Python

## Vehicle Dynamics
- Developed longitudinal braking models
- Incorporated aerodynamic downforce effects
- Analyzed speed-dependent braking performance

## Feedback Control (ABS)
- Implemented slip-ratio-based feedback control
- Used proportional control with saturation
- Compared open-loop vs closed-loop braking behavior

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Translating theory into physical system models
- Understanding feedback control in safety-critical systems
- Applying control concepts to real automotive scenarios
